"\nStep 1: Identify key details in the passage. The editorial discusses the structure of the present school calendar and its origins in early-twentieth-century agricultural life. It argues that the current school year is made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks, which were necessary for children to help with harvests. Now that agriculture no longer occupies most of our citizens, we can remove long breaks from the school calendar.\nStep 2: Identify the assumption. The editorial assumes that long breaks are unnecessary because agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens. Therefore, removing long breaks from the school calendar would serve the interests of children.\nSo, the answer is (E)."
"\nStep 1: Identify key details in the question. The question asks about the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherback turtles in captivity and in the wild.\nStep 2: Analyze the answer choices. Some of the answer choices mention specific characteristics or conditions that could affect the life expectancy of leatherbacks, such as diseases, predators, or the quality of the environment.\nStep 3: Consider the possible connection between the key details and the answer choices. For example, if fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than other large aquatic reptiles, this could explain why their life expectancy in captivity is similar to that in the wild. Or, if most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, this could also contribute to the apparent discrepancy.\nStep 4: Identify the correct answer. The correct answer is (D), as it directly addresses the issue of establishing an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks."

"\nStep 1: Identify key details in the passage. The passage states that the geography of modern cities is different due to the use of personal automobiles. It suggests that if personal automobiles were not used, the result would be a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now.\nStep 2: Analyze the argument. The argument seems to infer that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause (the use of personal automobiles) and that other facets of modern life also resulted from that cause. This is questionable because it assumes that the personal automobile is the only factor that has influenced the development of modern cities and lifestyles, which is not the case.\nStep 3: Identify the answer.

The mayor gives a reason that imposing large fees would reduce building starts, thus leading to less revenue.

The city needs money and the mayor keeps blocking measures that could bring money. This shows that the mayor is not acting in the city's best interests. The reason given by the mayor (reducing building starts would lead to less revenue) might be true, but it seems to be used as a cover for the real reason: personal interest.\nStep 3: Identify the conclusion. The conclusion is that the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests.\nThe answer is (C)."

"\nStep 1: Identify key details in the question. The question asks which statement most helps to explain the phenomenon described above.\nStep 2: Analyze the statement (A). If drivers have more accidents when they become distracted, then it might be that heavily traveled highways have lower rates of fatal accidents because there is less opportunity for drivers to become distracted. However, this doesn't seem to fully explain why the rate would be so low.\nStep 3: Analyze the statement (B). If the highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic, then it might be that as traffic volume increases, the rate of accidents decreases. This could be because more people are on the road, which means there are more witnesses to potential accidents and thus they are less likely to occur. However, this also doesn't seem to fully explain why the rate would be so low.\nStep 4: Analyze the statement (C). If most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work, then it might be that during these times, there are fewer people on the road who are likely to engage in risky behavior such as driving at high speeds or under the influence of alcohol. This could help explain why the rate of fatal accidents is lower on heavily traveled highways.\nStep 5: Analyze the statement (D). If most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed, then it might be that on heavily traveled highways, where speeds tend to be lower due to traffic congestion, there are fewer high-speed accidents. However, this doesn't seem to fully explain why the rate would be so low.\nStep 6: Analyze the statement (E). If heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks, then it might be that these types of vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents. However, this also doesn't seem to fully explain why the rate would be so low.\nStep 7: Choose the answer.

The argument in (A) is about the vitamin E supplements and their safety for all people. It states that we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day because it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people.

"\nStep 1: Identify the type of argument. This is an argument against a claim based on statistics.\nStep 2: Analyze the argument. The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to roads does not enhance the safety of bicyclists because it leads to more accidents. It uses a statistic that shows more accidents occur on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without them as evidence.\nStep 3: Identify possible criticisms. One criticism could be that the severity of injuries in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes might be less severe, on average, than those on roads without such lanes. Another criticism could be that there might be more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes, which could lead to more accidents even if the lanes themselves are safe.

The reasoning seems to be that if Waverly has included works of art that she has strong opinions about in her textbook, then she has not succeeded in presenting only objective accounts. This is because her writing about art she likes is better than her writing about art she is indifferent to, which suggests a bias.\nStep 5: Determine the conclusion.

"\nStep 1: Identify key details in the question. The islands are inhabited by several species of iguana that are closely related to species in the Americas. They must have rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.\nStep 2: Analyze the argument. The argument is based on the fact that these species exist in a place far away from where their progenitors lived, and suggests they must have rafted across the ocean.\nStep 3: Identify possible weaknesses in the argument. One possible weakness is if there were other species on the islands that are not found in the Americas. Another possibility is if genetic analysis showed the iguana species on the islands to be different from those in the Americas. A third possibility is if documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses were common. A fourth possibility is if fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands had been found in Australia. A fifth possibility is if the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America dated back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.\nStep 4: Determine the correct answer. The fifth possibility most weakens the scientist's argument because it suggests that the iguana species could have migrated to the islands from Australia, rather than across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas."
