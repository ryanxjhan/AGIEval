(D)Both of Greene's paintings and both of Hidalgo's paintings are displayed in lower positions. (E)Both of Greene's paintings and both of Hidalgo's paintings are displayed in upper positions.\nLet's think step by step.\n\nStep 1: We know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. So, each wall must have at least one oil painting.\nStep 2: We also know that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. So, each wall must have at least two students' works.\nStep 3: We know that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. So, at most one of Franz's paintings and at most one of Isaacs' paintings can be on the same wall.\nStep 4: Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means that either both of Franz's paintings are in the upper positions or both of Greene's paintings are in the lower positions.\nStep 5: Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. This means that at least one of Isaacs's paintings must be in the lower position, and since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, the other painting of Isaacs must be in the upper position.\nSo, the answer is (E).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is", "metadata": 223}
