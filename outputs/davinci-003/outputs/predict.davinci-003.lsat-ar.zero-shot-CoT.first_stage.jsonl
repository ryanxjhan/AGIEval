"\nStep 1: Fuentes photographs must appear in at least one but no more than three sections.\nStep 2: The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.\nSo, the answer is (E)."
"\nStep 1: We know that at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear. So, Fuentes can have maximum 3 photographs and Hue can have maximum 3 photographs.\nStep 2: The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Hue can have maximum 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section.\nStep 3: Since Gagnon's photographs cannot be in the Sports section, if Hue has 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Gagnon must have 2 photographs in the Metro section.\nSo, the answer is (B)."
