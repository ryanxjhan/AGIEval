On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons? Answer Choices: (A)Venus (B)Saturn (C)Uranus (D)Neptune\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 $\\frac{m}{sec^2}$. The object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth. Using the formula $W=mg$, we can say that the mass of the object is $150/9.8 = 15.3 kg$.\nThe acceleration due to gravity increases as you move away from the center of the planet. So, for a planet with a larger acceleration due to gravity, the weight of an object will be greater than on Earth.\nNeptune has the largest acceleration due to gravity among the planets mentioned in the answer choices.

(Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.) Answer Choices: (A)0.410 (B)0.357 (C)0.333 (D)0.250\nLet's think step by step.\n We know that there are 9 times as many right handed male students as left handed male students. Since the total number of right handed students is 122 and the total number of left handed students is 18, we can calculate the number of left handed male students.\nSo, the number of left handed male students = (122/9) * 18 = 204/9 = 23. This means that there are 122 - 23 = 99 right handed female students and 23 left handed male students. The total number of female students is therefore 99 + 23 = 122.

The question asks for the number of novels, so we will assume that she bought at least one novel.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:\n4(number of novels) + 1(number of magazines) = 20 (total cost)\n\nWe can now plug in the values we know and solve for the number of novels:\n4(3) + 1(8) = 20\n12 + 8 = 20\n\nSo, Sadie purchased 3 novels. The answer is (B).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is", "metadata": 114}

We want to find an expression equivalent to $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ for $x > 3$.

Assuming all the tents were filled to capacity and every person got to sleep in a tent, exactly how many of the tents were 2-person tents? Answer Choices: (A)30 (B)20 (C)19 (D)18 11\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe total number of people is 202 and the total number of tents is 60. The sum of the people in all the tents should be equal to 202. So, the number of 2-person tents can be found by dividing the total number of people by the number of people each 2-person tent can accommodate.\nThe number of 4-person tents can be found by subtracting the number of 2-person tents from the total number of tents. The number of people each 4-person tent can accommodate is 4. So, the sum of the people in all the 4-person tents can be found by multiplying the number of 4-person tents by 4.\nThe sum of the people in all the 2-person tents and all the 4-person tents should be equal to the total number of people, which is 202. So, we can set up an equation using this information and solve for the number of 2-person tents.\nThe number of 2-person tents = (total number of people) / (number of people each 2-person tent can accommodate)\nThe number of 4-person tents = (total number of tents) - (number of 2-person tents)\nSum of the number of people in all the 2-person tents and all the 4-person tents = (number of 2-person tents) * (number of people each 2-person tent can accommodate) + (number of 4-person tents) * (number of people each 4-person tent can accommodate)\nSo, we have an equation with two variables: the number of 2-person tents and the number of 4-person tents. We need to solve this equation to find the values of the variables.\nThe number of 2-person tents = (total number of people) / (number of people each 2-person tent can accommodate) = 202 / 2 = 101 R 1\nThe number of 4-person tents = (total number of tents) - (number of 2-person tents) = 60 - 101 = -41 R 1\nSince the number of 4-person tents cannot be negative, we know that there is an error in the question.

We need to find the value of 2w + 3t.\nSince we have two variables in two equations, we can eliminate one variable by substitution. Let's substitute the value of 4t from the first equation into the second equation: 4w + 5(4t/4) = 25 => 4w + 5t = 25. Now, we have only one variable left, which is w.\nNow, let's find the value of w: 4w + 5t = 25 => 4w = 25 - 5t => 4w = 10 - t. Now, we need to find the value of 2w + 3t.\nSubstitute the value of w in terms of t: 2w + 3t = (2 * 4w/4) + 3t => 2w + 3t = 8w/4 + 3t => 2w + 3t = 2(4w/4) + 3t => 2w + 3t = 2(10 - t) => 2w + 3t = 20 - 2t.\nNow, we need to find the value of 2w + 3t: 2w + 3t = 20 - 2t => 2w + 3t = 18/2 => 2w + 3t = 9.\nThe answer is (C).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is", "metadata": 209}
