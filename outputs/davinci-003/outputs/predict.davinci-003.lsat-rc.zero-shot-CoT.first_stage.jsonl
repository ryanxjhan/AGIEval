"\nStep 1: Identify key details in the passage. The passage discusses John Rawls' theory of justice, which is based on the idea of a fair procedure for settling what the principles of justice should be. The veil of ignorance is a key concept in this theory, representing a situation in which people are self-interested but do not know their own station in life, abilities, or tastes. They are motivated to arrive at a solution in which they will not lose, because nobody loses. This results in a just arrangement.\nStep 2: Identify the claim being questioned. The claim in lines 49-51 is that people, regardless of their plan of life, want certain \"primary goods,\" including rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, and income and wealth. Without these primary goods, people cannot accomplish their goals, whatever they may be.\nStep 3: Determine which answer choice addresses the claim being questioned. (D) Few people believe that they would be satisfied with only a minimum amount of primary goods. This answer choice suggests that not everyone values the fulfillment of their own preferences over the fulfillment of the preferences of strangers, as stated in (A). It also contradicts the idea that people are self-interested and motivated to arrive at a fair arrangement, as suggested by the veil of ignorance concept. Therefore, (D) most calls into question the claim in lines 49-51."

(A)The average amount of time it took new migrants to find employment in the North grew at a steady rate between 1915 and 1960. This answer choice suggests that the difficulty of finding employment in the North decreased over time, which would support the authors! analysis. (B)In general, communities of African Americans in the North consisted largely of individuals who shared a common geographic place of origin in the South. This answer choice suggests that the social and cultural support for migrants increased over time, which would support the authors! analysis. (C)Housing prices in the North fluctuated between high and low extremes from 1915 to 1960, while housing prices in the South remained relatively constant. This answer choice suggests that the cost of living in the North was more variable and potentially higher than in the South, which would support the authors! analysis. (D)To maintain a steady rate of recruitment after World War I, Northern employers had to send more and more labor agents to recruit employees in the South. This answer choice suggests that the demand for labor in the North was high and continuously increasing, which would support the authors! analysis. (E)There was a large-scale reverse migration of African Americans back to Southern locations later in the twentieth century. This answer choice suggests that the conditions in the North were less favorable than those in the South, which would undermine the authors! analysis.\nStep 3: Determine the correct answer. The correct answer is (B)In general, communities of African Americans in the North consisted largely of individuals who shared a common geographic place of origin in the South. This answer choice suggests that the social and cultural support for migrants increased over time, which would support the authors! analysis."
" Insider trading is a crime committed by individuals who have access to confidential information about a company and misuse it for personal benefit. The passage states that insider trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. So the answer is (D)."
"\nPositive and neutral - This means the author of passage A supports stock trades based on inside information while the author of passage B does not support such trades. So, the answer is (B)."
"\nInsider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. Insider trading can give some people an unfair advantage over others, which can undermine faith in the fairness of the market. So the answer is (A)."
"\nInsider trading is a crime because it allows people to make trades based on information they have ahead of the general public. This is bad for the market because it gives some people an unfair advantage and can undermine investor confidence. The relevant law should therefore prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.\nSo, the answer is (A)."

"\nStep 1: Identify key details from Passage A.\nThe entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don?t have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients.\nStep 2: Identify key details from Passage B.\nIn a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.\nStep 3: Compare the two passages.\nBoth passages discuss the importance of information in the stock market. Passage A presents it as an activity that gives some investors an unfair advantage over others, whereas passage B presents it as an activity that increases the transparency of the market. So, the answer is (C)."
"\nStep 1: Identify key details. The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychological research, particularly focusing on the modular theory of mind and the methodological approach of FMRI. It raises concerns about the validity of these methods and suggests that the brain may not be composed of separate modules.\nStep 2: Identify the main idea. The main idea is that the use of brain scans in psychological research relies on a questionable premise (the modular theory of mind) and a misleading methodological approach (the subtractive method of FMRI).\nSo, the answer is (B)."
"\nStep 1: The relevant sentence in the passage is: It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. So the answer is (A)."
"\nStep 1: The relevant sentence in the passage is: The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. So the answer is (E)."
"\nStep 1: Identify the key issue. The key issue is whether brain scans can be used as pictures of mental activity, given that the mind may not be decomposable into independent modules.\nStep 2: Determine the main argument. The main argument is that brain scans reveal well-defined areas that \"light up\", in response to various cognitive tasks, but this could be due to a subtraction method that obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.\nStep 3: Identify the answer. The answer is (D)."
"\nStep 1: Identify the key argument of the passage. The author is questioning the validity of using brain scans to study mental activities, suggesting that the modular theory of mind may be flawed.\nStep 2: Identify the main supporting point for this argument. The author compares brain scans to X-rays and suggests that both are methods used to \"see inside\" the body.\nStep 3: Determine the answer. The answer is (D)."
"\nStep 1: Identify key details in the passage. The passage discusses the modular theory of mind, which suggests that mental processes are independent modules based in different areas of the brain. William Uttal contends that this theory may be incorrect and that mental processes are more likely to be properties of a general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.\nStep 2: Identify the main idea. The main idea is that the modular theory of mind, which suggests that mental processes are independent modules based in different areas of the brain, may be incorrect.\nStep 3: Analyze the question and identify the key details. The question asks for the answer to a statement about the various mental processes being likely to be independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain.\nStep 4: Map the answers to the question. (A) is a direct reference to the modular theory of mind, suggesting that mental processes are independent modules based in different areas of the brain.\nStep 5: Determine the answer. The answer is (A)."
"\nStep 1: Identify key concepts in the passage.\nSubtractive method, modular theory of mind, distributed brain functions, metabolic activity, cognitive tasks.\nStep 2: Identify the statement that best describes these concepts.\nThe subtractive method produces images of the brain at work by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions. So, the answer is (C)."
" FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. So the answer is (A)."
