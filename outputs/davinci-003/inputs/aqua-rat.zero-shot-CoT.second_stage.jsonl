Answer Choices: (A)384 (B)562 (C)458 (D)156 (E)452\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe formula to calculate the average speed is s = d/t where, s is the average speed, d is the total distance and t is the total time. The total distance covered around the square will be the sum of distances covered on all sides.\nSince the plane flies at different speeds on different sides, we need to calculate the total distance covered on each side and then sum up these distances.\nThe distance covered by the plane on any side = speed × time. Since the plane changes its direction after covering half the side, the time taken will be half the side length divided by the speed.\nSo, the distance covered on any side = speed × (side length/2)\nNow, let's calculate the distance covered on each side:\n1st side: 200 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 400 m\n2nd side: 400 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 800 m\n3rd side: 600 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 1200 m\n4th side: 800 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 1600 m\nNow, let's sum up the distances covered on all sides:\nTotal distance = 400 m + 800 m + 1200 m + 1600 m = 5000 m\nNow, let's calculate the average speed:\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nTotal time = (side length) × (number of sides) = 400 m × 4 = 1600 m\nAverage speed = 5000 m / 1600 m = 3.125 km/hr\nThe answer: (E).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is", "metadata": 39}

Answer Choices: (A)20% (B)30% (C)40% (D)50% (E)60%\nThe given information is that 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. We need to find the percentage of students who are members of the swim team. Let S represent the number of students in Daifu university, let C represent the number of students who are members of the chess club, and let T represent the number of students who are members of the swim team. Then 24/100 * S = C = T + 20/100 * T Let's solve for T: T = 24/100 * S - 20/100 * T Let's simplify this equation: T = 24/100 * S - 20/100 * T + 20/100 * S Let's combine the terms that have S in them: T = (24 - 20)/100 * S Let's simplify this expression: T = 4/100 * S Let's multiply both sides by 100 to isolate T: T = 4% of S Now, we need to find what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team. To do this, we can use the fact that T is 4% of S and then convert this into a percentage of 100: (T/S) * 100 = 4% Let's multiply both sides by 1 to get rid of the fraction: (T/S) = 4/100 Let's multiply both sides by 100 to convert this into a percentage: (T/S) * 100 = 4% Now, we can plug in the value of T that we found earlier: (4/100) * 100 = 4% Let's simplify this expression: 4% = 4% Therefore, 4% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.

So, to find the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, we need to determine how many quarters of a mile the $8.50 will cover.\nFirst, we need to determine how much the cab charges for one quarter mile: The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. So, the charge for one quarter mile is $3.50 + 10¢ = $3.60.\nThen, we divide the total amount of money ($8.50) by the cost per quarter mile ($3.60): $8.50 / $3.60 ≈ 2.36. Since we cannot have a fraction of a quarter mile, we round up to the nearest whole number which is 3.\nSo, with $8.50, you can travel 3 quarters of a mile.\nThe maximum distance you can travel is 3 quarters of a mile which is 11.75 miles.

Answer Choices: (A)62, 35 (B)62, 34 (C)34, 62 (D)42, 62 (E)62, 42\nLet's think step by step.\n\nArjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This means that after Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have 2x dollars.\nIf Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This means that after Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have 3(y-10) dollars.\nThe problem states that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2x = 3(y-10).\nNow let's solve this equation for y in terms of x. We can first add 10 to both sides of the equation: 2x + 10 = 3y - 30. Then, we can divide both sides by 3: (2x + 10)/3 = y - 10. Finally, we can subtract 10 from both sides and solve for y: (2x + 10)/3 = y.\nNow let's find the value of x. We know that Sajal has twice the money left with Arjun after Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2x = 3(y-10). Substitute y from above: 2x = 3((2x + 10)/3 - 10)\nSimplify and solve for x: 2x = 2x + 10 - 30 => 2x = -20 => x = -10.\nSince the amount of money cannot be negative, there is no solution to this problem.

Answer Choices: (A)56 (B)58 (C)60 (D)62 (E)64\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by 1/2 * base * height. If the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, then 1/2 * base * height = 70. Since the two triangles are congruent, they have the same base and height. So, base * height = 140. The base is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by cutting the diagonal of the rectangle. So, using the Pythagorean theorem, we get that the original side length of the square cloth is √(140 + 4^2) = √(140 + 16) = √156 = 12 feet. The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length.

What is the probability that event B occurs? Answer Choices: (A)0.5 (B)0.6 (C)0.7 (D)0.8 (E)0.9\nLet's think step by step.\n Independent events are events whose occurrence does not depend on the outcome of other events. If A and B are independent, then the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. This means that the probability of the union of A and B is 0.96. We know that the probability of the union of two events is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the product of their individual probabilities. So, we can set up an equation using this information: 0.96 = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB). Since A and B are independent, P(AB) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting this into the equation gives us: 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)). Solving for P(B): 0.96 - 0.6 - 0.6P(B) = 0. Therefore, 0.36 = -0.6P(B). Solving for P(B): P(B) = 0.36 / -0.6.

This implies that each bouquet should have an equal number of both white and red tulips. So, we need to find the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be formed by dividing the total number of tulips equally among them.\nThe total number of tulips is 98 (red) + 28 (white) = 126 tulips. If we divide these 126 tulips equally among the bouquets, each bouquet will have 126/4 = 31.5 tulips. Since we cannot have half a tulip, this is not possible.\nThe next multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 126 is 128. So, we can form 128/4 = 32 bouquets with 126 tulips. However, since 126 is not a multiple of 32, some of these bouquets will have fewer tulips than others.\nThe greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips is 32.

So, |x^3| > |y^2| means x^3 is farther away from 0 than y^2 is. Since x<0, it must be that x^3 is negative. Similarly, since y>0, it must be that y^2 is positive. Therefore, the absolute value of x^3 (which must be negative) is greater than the absolute value of y^2 (which is positive). So, the distance from 0 to –x^3 is greater than the distance from 0 to y^2. This means that –x^3 > y^2. Therefore, the answer is (C).\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is", "metadata": 165}

Answer Choices: (A)247.67 (B)237.67 (C)227.67 (D)215.67 (E)None of these\nLet's think step by step.\n\nThe problem is asking for highest simple interest rate. Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. Here time is given in years and rate is compounded annually.\nSo, the formula becomes SI = P * R * T Where P = 20000, R = ?, T = 30/12 (as 4/30 means 4 equal installments in 30 days) Now we need to maximize the simple interest rate.\nThe problem is that there is also a discount of n/100 which means the merchant will get a discount of n% on the invoice amount. This discount will reduce the principal amount. So, the effective principal becomes (20000 - 2000n) Now we need to maximize the simple interest rate with this effective principal.\nThe formula for simple interest with effective principal becomes SI = (P - D) * R * T Where P - D = 20000 - 2000n and D is the discount in dollars.\nNow let's express the discount in terms of rate. Since n/100 means n% discount, we can write D = 0.02n Now we have to maximize the simple interest rate with respect to this new variable (D or n).\nThe formula becomes SI = (20000 - 0.02n) * R * (30/12) Now let's differentiate the simple interest rate with respect to n and set it equal to zero to find the maximum rate.\ndSI/dn = -0.02R*(30/12) Now setting this equation equal to zero, we get 0.02R*(30/12) = 0 This simplifies to R = (30/6)*(1/2) = 5 The highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 5%.

The weight of the coin can be calculated using the formula W = ρV, where ρ is the density. Since the weight of the coin is given, we can find the density of the alloy. Once we know the density of aluminum and silver, we can calculate the ratio of their volumes in the alloy. Finally, we can use this ratio to find the volume of a coin made of pure aluminum with the same dimensions as the original coin.
