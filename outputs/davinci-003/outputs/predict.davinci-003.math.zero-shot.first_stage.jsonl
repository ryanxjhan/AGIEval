" 20.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's sketch the graphs of the functions $y = |x - 1| + |x - 3|$ and $y = 8.$\n\nWe can see that the region above the first graph but below the second one is a trapezoid. To find its area, we need to determine the lengths of its sides.\n\nSince the function $y = |x - 1| + |x - 3|$ has a symmetry with respect to the vertical axis, it's enough to consider half of the trapezoid. So, let's find the x-coordinate where the function intersects the vertical line $x = 2.$\n\nUsing the absolute value property, we have:\n\n$|(2 - 1)| + |(2 - 3)| = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\nSo, the point where the function intersects the vertical line $x = 2$ is $(2, 2).$\n\nNow, we can find the slope of the line segment connecting this point to the point $(0, 8):$\n\nm = (8 - 2) / (2 - 0) = 6\n\nThen, using the point-slope form of a linear equation, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),$ we can find the equation of the line passing through $(2, 2)$ and $(0, 8):$\n\n$y - 2 = 6(x - 2) \\Rightarrow y = 6x - 10$\n\nNow, we can find the x-intercept of this line:\n\n$0 = 6x - 10 \\Rightarrow x = 10/6 \\approx 1.67$\n\nThe length of the base of the trapezoid is $2 - 0 = 2,$ and the height is $8 - (-10) = 18.$\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is $1/2 * 2 * 18 = 20.$"
" 14.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We know that the degree of the sum of two polynomials does not exceed the sum of their degrees. So, in this case, the maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7 + 7 = 14.\n2. On the other hand, the degree of the product of two polynomials does not exceed the minimum of their degrees. Since both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have degree 7, their product has a maximum possible degree of 7.\n3. Therefore, the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7 * 14 = 98.\n4. However, since the actual degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ are less than 14, we need to find the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees without considering the actual degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n5. In this case, the minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0 (if both polynomials are zero), so the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees is 0 * 14 = 0.\n6. However, since we are looking for the maximum possible product, we need to consider the case where $f(x) + g(x)$ has degree 7 (the maximum possible degree). So, the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees is 7 * 7 = 49.\n7. Therefore, the answer is 49."
" -3.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. To find the minimum value of the function, we need to find the values of x that make the derivative equal to zero or negative.\n2. The derivative of the function is given by: f(x) = (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3).\n3. Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get: (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0.\n4. Solving for x, we find that there are three distinct solutions: x = -1, x = -2, and x = -3.\n5. Since the function is quadratic in each of these intervals, it will have a minimum value at each endpoint.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value of the function occurs at one of these points: x = -1, x = -2, or x = -3.\n7. Comparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the minimum value is -3: f(-3) = (-3 + 1)(-3 + 2)(-3 + 3) = 0."

" 1260.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to choose 3 men out of the 30 available. This can be done using combinations, which means we use the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n2. So, C(30, 3) = 30! / (3!(30-3)!) = 4060.\n3. Now, we have chosen 3 men. There are now only 27 remaining men and 40 women left in the pool of available members.\n4. Next, we need to choose 4 women out of the 27 available. Using the same combination formula, we get:\nC(27, 4) = 27! / (4!(27-4)!) = 3510.\n5. Finally, since there are 3 men and 4 women on the committee, we need to distribute them among the available spots. This can be done using permutations, which means we use the formula P(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to arrange.\n6. So, P(7, 3) * P(7, 4) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) * 7! / (4!(7-4)!) = 210 * 210 = 4200.\n7.

" $6$.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Since the line segment passes through $(3,9)$ and has a midpoint at $(1,2)$, it must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n2. Symmetry with respect to the y-axis means that the two endpoints of the line segment are equidistant from the y-axis.\n3. Therefore, the other endpoint of the line segment is also on the y-axis, and its coordinates are $(x,9-x)$.\n4. To find the sum of the coordinates of this other endpoint, we simply add them together: $x + (9-x) = 10$.\n5. Solving for x, we get $x = 6$, so the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is $6$."

There are C(5,1) ways to choose 1 Republican, C(6,1) ways to choose 1 Democrat, and C(2,1) ways to choose 1 Independent.\n4. Since these choices are independent of each other, we can multiply the number of ways for each group to get the total number of ways to form the subcommittee: C(5,1) * C(6,1) * C(2,1) = 10 * 6 * 2 = 120.\n5.

Solving this system will give us all possible solutions to the equation (a+bi)(c+di) = 10 with integer coefficients.\n\nTo solve this system, we can use Gaussian elimination or any other method for solving Diophantine equations.

Working our way up from the bottom of the tenth row, we see that the third element (counting from the left) is the sum of the two elements above it.

There are ten possible digits (0-9), and we can choose any two of them to form a two-digit number.\n3. To find the number of combinations, we use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n4. In this case, n = 10 (the number of possible digits) and k = 2 (we need to choose two digits).\n5. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 45.\n6. Now we need to divide the total number of combinations by 2 because each page number consists of two digits (for example, 12, 21, or 34).\n7. Therefore, there are 45 / 2 = 22 pages with page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4.\n8. However, we must also consider the pages with number 0 and 1, which have only one digit. There are ten pages with a single-digit page number (0-9).\n9. In total, there are 22 + 10 = 32 pages with page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4 or less.\n10. Since the textbook has 1,000 pages, we subtract the number of pages with small digit sums from the total page count: 1,000 - 32 = 968 pages remain.\n11. Finally, we need to find the number of pages with page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4 among the remaining pages.\n12.

Now, we need to find how many of these pages have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4.\n14. We can use the same combination formula as before: C(10, 2) = 45.\n15. Since there are 990 pages with two-digit page numbers, we multiply the number of combinations by the number of pages: 45 * 990 = 43,550.\n16.

Finally, we divided by $2$ to get the number of ways to fill in the tens digit and hundreds digit, which should be $48$.\n\nBut the answer is supposed to be 10.

To achieve this, we can try to make $a$ as small as possible while keeping it positive and relatively prime to $b.$\n4.

" 360 tickets.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Let's first consider the case when up to 60 tickets are bought in one order, so each ticket costs $\\$70$. In this case, the total revenue from selling these tickets would be 60 * $\\$70 = \\$4200$.\n2. Now let's consider the second scenario where more than 60 tickets are bought in a single order. The price of each ticket decreases by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought after the first 60 tickets. So, if we buy one more ticket (i.e., 61 tickets), the price per ticket becomes $\\$70 - \\$1 = \\$69$.\n3.

We want to find the largest number of tickets $t$ such that the total revenue from selling these tickets is greater than or equal to $\\$4200$. To do this, we can set up an equation representing the total revenue for any given number of tickets:\n   Total Revenue = (70 * 60) + (69 * 59) + ... + (68 * 1)\n5. This equation can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In our case, n = t, a = 70, and l = 68.\n   Total Revenue = t/2 * (70 + 68)\n6. Now we can rearrange this equation to solve for t:\n   t/2 * (138) = 4200\n   t/2 = 4200 / 138\n   t = 4200 * 2 / 138\n7. Simplifying the fraction, we get:\n   t ≈ 360\n\nTherefore, the largest number of tickets $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is approximately 360 tickets."
" 4 scoops.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the volume of one scoop of ice cream. Since an ice cream scoop is a sphere, its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr^3.\n2. For the given radius of 1 inch, the volume of one scoop would be V = (4/3)π(1)^3 = (4/3)π.\n3. Now, we need to find out how many scoops fit into an ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and height of 5 inches. The volume of the cone can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cone: V = (1/3)πr^2h.\n4. Plugging in the given values, we get V = (1/3)π(2)^2(5) = 20π cubic inches.\n5. Finally, to determine how many scoops fit into the cone, we divide the volume of the cone by the volume of one scoop: 20π / ((4/3)π) = 15.\n6. However, since an ice cream scoop is typically larger than 1 inch in diameter (to account for melting), we need to consider that each scoop will melt slightly as it melts into the cone. This means that we will have fewer scoops than what our calculation suggests.\n7. Assuming a reasonable estimate of about 0.8 inches in diameter for the melted scoop (since it needs to fit into the cone), we can calculate the volume of the melted scoop: V = (4/3)π(0.8)^3 ≈ 0.291 cubic inches.\n8. Therefore, with each scoop melting down to about this size, we would need approximately 20π / 0.291 ≈ 68.5 scoops to fill the cone completely.\n9. However, since this seems like an excessive number of scoops, we can consider a more realistic scenario where only some of the ice cream melts into the cone. For example, if we assume that about half of each scoop melts into the cone (leaving the other half to be served on top), then we would need 68.5 / 2 = 34.25 scoops.\n10. Since we cannot have a fraction of a scoop, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 35 scoops.\n\nSo, it takes 35 scoops of ice cream to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches when assuming that half of each scoop melts into the cone."

Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can consider them as two sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse being the diagonal of longer length (16 units).\n4. Applying the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.\n5. In this case, a = 12 units, b = 12 units, and c = 16 units.\n6.

" $4$.\n\nProof. We are given that $a$ is a root of the quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$, and we want to find how many roots $b$ can be for this equation. Since the roots of a quadratic equation are unique, it follows that $b$ cannot be a root of the given equation.\n\nNow let's consider the quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$. This equation has two distinct real roots if and only if $a^2 - 4b < 0$. In this case, the roots are given by\n\n$x = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}.$\n\nSince $a^2 - 4b < 0$, the square root of $a^2 - 4b$ is imaginary. Therefore, the roots of the equation are complex conjugates of each other.\n\nNow let's count the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a$ is a root of $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ and $b$ is a root of $x^2 + ax + b = 0$. Since $a$ cannot be a root of the second equation, there are $4$ possible values for $(a,b)$:\n\n1. $a = 0$, $b = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n2. $a = 0$, $b = \\frac{1}{2}$\n3. $a = -\\sqrt{2}$, $b = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n4. $a = -\\sqrt{2}$, $b = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n\nThus, there are $4$ ordered pairs $(a,b)$ that satisfy the conditions of the problem."

To find the longest side of the triangle, we can compare the lengths of a, b, and c:\n   Since √13 < √10 < √12, we know that c is the longest side.\n3.

To do this, we can use the fact that each number is a fraction of the sum of all four numbers, which is 10.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum value of $\\frac{a}{9}.$ Since $a$ is a positive real number and $a \\leq 10,$ the maximum value of $a$ will be 10. Therefore, $\\frac{a}{9}$ will have its maximum value when $a = 10.$\n\nNext, let's find the maximum value of $\\frac{b^2}{8}.$ Since $b$ is a positive real number and $b \\leq 10,$ the maximum value of $b$ will be 10.

We know that the sum of the lengths of all six sides is equal to twice the perimeter of the hexagon, which is given by the formula P = 6a (where a is the length of one side).\n\nSo, we have:\n1 + 7 + 2 + 4 + x + y = 2 * 6a\n\nSince the first four sides have lengths 1, 7, 2, and 4, we can write the equation as:\n8 + x + y = 12a\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x + y when a = 1 (the length of the first side).

" 12.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We need to find the number of positive multiples of 13 that have three digits.\n2. To do this, we can look at the factors of 13 and see how many times they appear in a multiple of 13.\n3. The factors of 13 are 1, 13, and 13*13 = 169.\n4. Since we're looking for multiples with three digits, we can ignore the factor of 1 because it will always be part of any multiple of 13.\n5. Now, we need to determine how many times the factor of 13 appears in a three-digit multiple.\n6. There are 9 two-digit numbers that have a product of 13 with their digits reversed (e.g., 23 and 32).\n7. However, since we're looking for multiples of 13, we need to add the factor of 13 to each of these numbers to get the actual multiples. So, we have 9 * 13 = 117 multiples.\n8. Finally, we need to determine how many times the factor of 13*13 appears in a three-digit multiple.\n9. There is only one three-digit number that has a product of 13*13 with its digits reversed (e.g., 123 and 321), so we have 1 * 169 = 169 multiples.\n10. Adding the number of multiples from steps 7 and 8, we get 117 + 169 = 326 positive multiples of 13.\n11. Since we're looking for three-digit multiples, we need to find the number of three-digit multiples in the total number of multiples.\n12.

" 18.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nLet's denote the numbers in Katie's list as x_1, x_2, ..., x_n. Since the sum of the numbers is equal to the sum of their squares, we can write two equations:\n\n1) x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = 0\n2) x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean (average) of the numbers on her list. The arithmetic mean is computed as:\n\nMean = (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n) / n\n\nWe want to maximize this value while still satisfying the two equations above. To do this, we can try to find the largest possible values for x_i's that satisfy both equations.\n\nFirst, let's consider equation (1). If we replace each x_i with its absolute value |x_i|, the equation remains true:\n\n|x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_n| = 0\n\nNow, since |x_i| ≥ 0 for all i, this implies that x_i = 0 for all i. So, one possible solution is that all the numbers in Katie's list are zero. In this case, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean would be 0.\n\nHowever, there's another solution that gives a larger mean. Consider the following set of numbers:\n\nx_1 = 6, x_2 = 4, x_3 = -4, x_4 = 6\n\nThese numbers satisfy both equations (1) and (2), and they have a larger mean than the previous solution:\n\nMean = (6 + 4 - 4 + 6) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3\n\nSo, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean is 3. However, since Katie has more than four numbers on her list, we need to find a way to extend this solution to include more numbers without violating the equations.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we found that the following set of numbers satisfies both equations for n = 6:\n\nx_1 = 6, x_2 = 4, x_3 = -4, x_4 = 6, x_5 = -6, x_6 = 6\n\nMean = (6 + 4 - 4 + 6 - 6 + 6) / 6 = 18 / 6 = 3\n\nSo, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean is still 3, but now we have found a solution with six numbers instead of four. Since Katie has more than six numbers on her list, we can continue this process by adding more pairs of equal magnitudes and alternating signs (like in the example above).\n\nBy iteratively adding such pairs of numbers, we can find solutions for larger lists of numbers while still maintaining the largest possible mean value. Therefore, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of Katie's numbers is 18."

Therefore, the GCD of 30 and 47 is also 30.\n\nSince the GCD is 30, any multiple of 30 will satisfy the congruence. The smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence is therefore 1, as it is a multiple of 30."

" approximately 0.2439.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We need to find the proportion of perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n2. There are 10 perfect squares in this range (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100).\n3. To calculate the probability, we divide the number of perfect squares by the total number of numbers in the range: Probability = Number of Perfect Squares / Total Numbers = 10 / 100 = 0.1 or 10%.\n4. However, since a perfect square is also a multiple of 1, we need to account for those as well. There are 9 multiples of 1 in the range (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).\n5. So, now we have 19 perfect squares or multiples of 1 out of a total of 100 numbers.\n6. To find the probability, divide the number of perfect squares or multiples of 1 by the total number of numbers: Probability = Number of Perfect Squares or Multiples of 1 / Total Numbers = 19 / 100 ≈ 0.19 or 19%.\n7. The probability that the number is a perfect square is approximately 0.2439, which is obtained by subtracting the probability of being a multiple of 1 from the original probability: Probability (Perfect Square) = Original Probability - Probability (Multiple of 1) = 0.19 - 0.1 = 0.09 or 9%."

" 3.\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this:\n\n1. We are given two equations:\n   a) a + b = c\n   b) b + c = 11\n2. We also know that c = 8 from the problem statement.\n3. Now, we can substitute the value of c (which is 8) into both equations to eliminate it:\n   a) a + b = 8\n   b) b + 8 = 11\n4. Next, we can solve the system of equations by subtracting equation (b) from equation (a):\n   0 = 3\n   This means that our original equation (a) is true regardless of the values of a and b.\n5. However, we need to find the value of a specifically. To do this, we can use any of the two equations above. Let's use equation (b):\n   b + c = 11\n6. We know that c = 8, so we can substitute it into equation (b):\n   8 + b = 11\n7. Now, we can solve for b:\n   b = 3\n8. Finally, since b = 3 and c = 8, we can find the value of a using equation (a):\n   a + 3 = 8\n9. Solving for a gives us:\n   a = 5\n\nBut there's another solution! If we look at the problem again, we realize that there is no unique solution for a. The reason is that the equations are not independent - they have a common variable (c). In this case, we can rearrange one of the equations to make c the subject:\n\n10. From equation (b), we can write c = 11 - b.\n11. Now, substitute this expression for c in equation (a):\n    a + b = 11 - b\n12. Simplify the equation:\n    2a = 11\n13. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for a:\n    a = 5.5\n\nSo, there are two possible values for a: 5 and 5.5. However, since we were asked to find the value of a, let's consider the case where a = 5. Then b = 3 and c = 8, which satisfies both equations. Therefore, the value of a is 3."

Next, we know that there are 18 representatives on the Student Council. Since these representatives should be elected fairly from both grades, we can find the total number of students who will be represented by dividing the total number of students by the number of representatives: 1170 / 18 = 65.\n3. Now, we need to determine how many representatives should come from the 8th grade. To do this, we can multiply the total number of students who will be represented by the percentage of students in the 8th grade (since there are more students in the 8th grade): 65 * (650 / 1170) = 325.\n4. Therefore, the 8th grade should have 325 representatives on the Student Council for a fair representation of both grades."

Now, let's find all ordered pairs of real numbers that satisfy this equation. Since the left side is a polynomial in both a and b, it must be equal to zero for some values of a and b.\n3. To find these values, we can solve the equation for one variable in terms of the other:\n   $a^4 - b^4 = a^3 + ab^2 \\Rightarrow a^4 - a^3 - ab^2 = 0$.\n4.

This can be done using the stars and bars method:\n   Number of ways = C(6,5) = 15\n2. Now, we need to consider Manoj. Since Manoj refuses to be in a class without any of his friends, he can only be assigned to a class that contains at least one of his friends.\n3. There are two scenarios for assigning Manoj: either he is with his friends or he is not.\n4. In the first scenario, Manoj can be assigned to the chemistry class if all 5 of his friends are in the biology class (1 way) or if any 4 of them are in the biology class and the remaining friend is in the chemistry class (C(5,4) ways). So there are 1 + C(5,4) = 2 ways to assign Manoj to the chemistry class.\n5. In the second scenario, Manoj can be assigned to the biology class if all 5 of his friends are in the chemistry class (1 way) or if any 4 of them are in the chemistry class and the remaining friend is in the biology class (C(5,4) ways).

We need to find the largest possible value of b when this relation holds.\n\nFirst, substitute x_2 = t into the given equation:\n\n(2t)^2 + bt + 18 = 0\n\nNow, factor out t:\n\nt(2t + b) = -18\n\nSince t is a real number, it cannot be zero. Thus, we have:\n\n2t + b = -18 / t\n\nNow, let's find the largest possible value of b when this equation holds. To do this, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\nb = -18/t - 2t\n\nThe right-hand side of the equation depends on the value of t. We want to maximize b, so we should try to minimize the absolute value of the right-hand side. To do this, we can set t = 1 (since t cannot be zero). Then:\n\nb = -18/1 - 2(1)\nb = -18 - 2\nb = -20\n\nThus, the largest possible value of b is -20. However, since we are looking for a real value of b, this solution does not work.\n\nNow, let's try t = -1 (since t cannot be zero). Then:\n\nb = -18/(-1) + 2(-1)\nb = 18 + 2\nb = 20\n\nThus, the largest possible value of b is 20. Since we are looking for a real value of b, this solution works.\n\nSo, the answer is that the largest possible value of b is 20."

" $k = 17$.\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this:\n\n1. We want to find the largest value of $k$ such that both $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ can be factors of some cubic polynomial $P(x)$.\n2. To achieve this, we need to find a cubic polynomial $P(x)$ with coefficients such that when we substitute it into the polynomials $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$, they become zero.\n3. We can write the cubic polynomial as $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$.\n4. Now, let's find the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ by setting up the equations:\n   - $Q_1(x) = P(x)$\n   - $Q_2(x) = P(x)$\n5. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n   - $a + (k - 29) = 0$\n   - $2a + (2k - 43) = 0$\n6. From these equations, we can express $a$ in terms of $k$:\n   - $a = -(k - 29)$\n7.

Solve for $k$:\n   - $k = 17$\n\nHence, the largest value of $k$ for which both $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ can be factors of a cubic polynomial $P(x)$ is $k = 17$."

We can do this by prime factorization and then multiplying the highest power of each prime number that appears in either number.\n\nThe prime factorization of 171 is 17 x 17, so the highest power of 17 is 2. The prime factorization of 468 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3, so the highest power of 2 is 2 and the highest power of 3 is 1.\n\nNow we can calculate the LCM:\n\nLCM = 17^2 * 2^2 * 3^1\n     = 289 * 4 * 9\n     = 1156\n\nNow let's find all possible values of $n$ such that both of the following are true:\n\n$171\\equiv80\\pmod{n}$ and $468\\equiv13\\pmod{n}$.\n\nSince 171 + 80 = 251, we can write the first congruence as:\n\n251 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}\n\nSince 468 + 13 = 481, we can write the second congruence as:\n\n481 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}\n\nNow let's find all divisors of LCM that satisfy both congruences. We already know that n must be a factor of LCM, so we can start by trying with n = 29:\n\n29 divides 171 and 468, so it divides their LCM, 1156.

Since the zeros of the polynomial are integers, we can express them as $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2,$ which satisfy the equation $f(\\alpha_i) = 0$ for $i=1,2.$\n4. Now, we know that the sum of the roots is equal to -b/a, so $\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = -b/a.$\n5. Since both $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are integers, it must be true that $b/a$ is also an integer.\n6.

" 1.\n\nHere's a proof using the factorization theorem for polynomials:\n\nLet $(a,b,c)$ be an ordered triplet of rational numbers such that $a,b,c$ are roots of the polynomial $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Then we have:\n\n(1) Since $a$ is a root, we have $a^3 + a^2b + ac = 0$.\n(2) Similarly, since $b$ is a root, we have $b^3 + ab^2 + bc = 0$.\n(3) Finally, since $c$ is a root, we have $c^3 + ac^2 + bc = 0$.\n\nNow let's solve the system of equations (1), (2), and (3). We can add them up to get:\n\n$(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2b + ab^2 + ac^2) + (ab + bc + ca) = 0$.\n\nExpanding the left-hand side gives us $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + a^2b + ab^2 + ac^2 + ab + bc + ca = 0$.\n\nSince $a,b,c$ are rational numbers and none of them are zero (since they are roots), it must be that $ab + bc + ca = 0$. This implies that either $a=0$, or $b=0$, or $c=0$. But since $a,b,c$ are roots of the same polynomial, we cannot have any of them equal to zero.\n\nTherefore, we must have $ab + bc + ca = 0$. This means that $a,b,c$ are proportional to each other; i.e., there exist non-zero rational numbers $\\lambda,\\mu,\\nu$ such that $a=\\lambda\\mu\\nu$, $b=\\lambda\\nu\\mu$, and $c=\\mu\\nu\\lambda$.\n\nThus, up to a proportionality constant, the only ordered triplets of rational numbers satisfying the given conditions are $(1,1,1)$, $(-1,-1,-1)$, $(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,\\mp 2)$, and $(\\pm 2,\\pm 1,\\mp 1)$.

Since $p_i^{r-s}<6$, it means that $p_i<6$. But since $p_i$ is the smallest prime number dividing $\\frac nk$, we must have $p_i=5$.\n4. Now, let $q_j$ be the smallest prime number such that $q_j^s|\\gcd(n,k)$, where $s$ is a positive integer. Since $\\gcd(n,k)|n$, we have $q_j^s|n$.\n5.

Now, let's look at the factors of $6n+3$, $6n+2$, and $6n+1$.\n\nFor $6n+3$: Since $6n+3$ is odd, its only positive divisors are odd numbers. The smallest odd factor is 3. So, $6n+3$ has no common factors with $6n+4$.\n\nFor $6n+2$: Similarly, the smallest odd factor for $6n+2$ is 2. Therefore, $6n+2$ also has no common factors with $6n+4$.\n\nFor $6n+1$: The smallest odd factor for $6n+1$ is 1.

However, we need to consider the negative signs as well since they can affect the final result.\n9. We can see that there are two possible negative signs: either all the factors are positive or one of them is negative.\n10. Therefore, there are 2 * 8 = 16 distinct values for AB + CD + EF after considering the negative signs.\n11. Finally, we need to find the distinct values of x+y+z by subtracting 2(AC + BD + EF) from AB + CD + EF.\n12.

" 16.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Since the pieces are indistinguishable and must be in the same row or the same column, we can treat them as a single unit.\n2. Now, we need to find the number of ways to place this single unit on an $8\\times 8$ chessboard with no restrictions.\n3. We can use the \"diagonal method\" for this problem: there are $8$ diagonals on the chessboard, and we can place the piece on any one of them.\n4. Since there are $8$ diagonals, there are $8$ possible placements for the piece.\n5. Now, we need to account for the fact that the piece must either be in the same row or the same column. We can do this by dividing the total number of placements by 2, since there are two ways the piece can satisfy this condition (either in the same row or the same column).\n6. So, the total number of ways to place the piece on the chessboard is $8 / 2 = 4$.\n7. Since we have two pieces and we want to find the number of distinct arrangements, we need to multiply the number of placements for the first piece by the number of placements for the second piece: $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 ways to put down two indistinguishable pieces on an ordinary $8\\times 8$ chessboard, if the pieces must either be in the same row or be in the same column."

To find the volume of the pyramid, we can use the formula V = (1/3)bh, where b is the area of the base and h is the height.\n4. Since it's a square base, we can calculate the area using the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side. So, A = (3 cm)^2 = 9 square centimeters.\n5.

" 1/3.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.

To resolve this issue, let's consider the following:\n\n4. When choosing two 2-digit numbers randomly, there are more even numbers than odd numbers (i.e., 10 even numbers vs. 9 odd numbers). Therefore, it's more likely to get an even product when multiplying two randomly chosen 2-digit numbers.\n5. The probability of getting an even product is now 1/3 or approximately 33.33%."

" 280.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We can represent the polynomial as a sum of terms involving only nonnegative integers.\n2. Since the coefficients are all nonnegative integers, we can use the binomial theorem to expand the polynomial.\n3. The binomial theorem states that for any nonnegative integer n, the expansion of $(x+1)^n$ is given by $\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} x^k.$\n4. Therefore, we can write $p(x) = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^4 {4 \\choose k} (x-1)^k.$\n5. Now we need to find $p(6).$ To do this, substitute x = 6 into the expanded form of the polynomial:\n   $p(6) = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^4 {4 \\choose k} (6-1)^k = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^4 {4 \\choose k} 5^k$\n6. To find the value of $p(6),$ we need to calculate the sum of the terms in the expansion:\n   $p(6) = {4 \\choose 0} 5^0 + {4 \\choose 1} 5^1 + {4 \\choose 2} 5^2 + {4 \\choose 3} 5^3 + {4 \\choose 4} 5^4$\n7. Calculate the values of the binomial coefficients:\n   ${4 \\choose 0} = 1, {4 \\choose 1} = 4, {4 \\choose 2} = 6, {4 \\choose 3} = 4, {4 \\choose 4} = 1$\n8. Substitute the values of the binomial coefficients and powers of 5 into the equation:\n   $p(6) = (1)(5^0) + (4)(5^1) + (6)(5^2) + (4)(5^3) + (1)(5^4)$\n9. Calculate the powers of 5 and their sum:\n   $p(6) = (1)(1) + (4)(5) + (6)(25) + (4)(125) + (1)(3125)$\n10. Add the terms together to find $p(6):$\n    $p(6) = 1 + 20 + 150 + 500 + 3125 = 3746$\n11. However, the problem states that the coefficients of the polynomial are all nonnegative integers. Since the coefficient of the term $x^4$ is $-1$ (which is not a nonnegative integer), this contradicts the given condition.\n12. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement, and it should instead ask for the value of $p(6)$ when $p(1) = 4$ and $p(5) = -136.$ In this case, we can use the same method to find $p(6):$\n    $p(6) = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^4 {4 \\choose k} (6-1)^k = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^4 {4 \\choose k} 5^k$\n    $p(6) = (1)(5^0) + (4)(5^1) + (6)(5^2) + (4)(5^3) + (1)(5^4)$\n    $p(6) = (1)(1) + (4)(5) + (6)(25) + (4)(125) + (1)(3125)$\n    $p(6) = 1 + 20 + 150 + 500 + 3125 = 3746$\n\nSo the answer is 3746."

Now, let's square the left side of the equation: $63 - \\sqrt{x} = 63 - \\sqrt{x}$. Since the left side remains unchanged when squared, this means that $n^2$ must also remain unchanged.

" 120.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We have 8 pens in total, and we need to divide them among 4 dogs, 3 cats, and 1 rooster.\n2. To find the number of ways to make the allocation, we use the concept of stars and bars. Imagine placing 7 dividers between the 8 pens: one on each side of the rooster pen, and the remaining 5 in between the animal pens.\n3. The number of ways to arrange these 7 dividers is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 5 positions for them out of the 8 available (since there are 8 - 1 = 7 possible positions), which is given by the combination formula C(8, 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!) = 56 ways.\n4. However, we must also consider that the rooster pen can be placed anywhere along the wall, so there are 8 possible locations for it. This adds an additional factor of 8 to our calculation.\n5. Therefore, the total number of ways to allocate the pens is 56 * 8 = 448.\n6. But we must also consider that the order in which the animals appear does not matter (e.g., it doesn't matter if the dogs are on one side or the other). Since there are 4 dogs and 3 cats, there are 4!/2! = 6 ways to arrange them without changing their meaning.\n7. So, we divide the total number of allocations by this factor to get the number of unique allocations: 448 / 6 = 74.\n8. However, we made an error in step 6: we forgot to account for the rooster's position relative to the dogs and cats. Since there are 3 possible positions for the rooster pen (between the dogs, between the cats, or alone), we need to divide the total number of allocations by this factor as well.\n9. Therefore, the final answer is 448 / (6 * 3) = 120 ways."

" 12 seconds.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. During the first second after takeoff, the plane climbs 100 feet.\n2. In the second second, it climbs an additional 100 feet more than it did in the first second. That means it climbs 200 feet during the second second (since 100 + 100 = 200).\n3. Similarly, in the third second, it climbs an additional 100 feet more than it did in the second second. That means it climbs 300 feet during the third second (since 100 + 200 = 300).\n4. This pattern continues, with the plane's altitude increasing by 100 feet each second.\n5. To find out how many seconds it takes for the plane to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet above its takeoff height, we can use the formula: Altitude = Time * Climbing rate + Initial altitude\n6. Plugging in the values, we get: 12,000 = x * 100 + 0, where x represents the number of seconds it takes to reach 12,000 feet.\n7. Solving for x, we get: 12,000 = 100x => x = 120/100 => x = 12 seconds.\n8. Therefore, it takes 12 seconds for the plane to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet above its takeoff height."

" 10.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Since the equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, we can write the equation as follows:\n   $a^2-6a+2 = 29$\n   $b^2-6b+2 = 29$\n\n2. Now let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n   $(a^2-b^2)-(6a-6b) = 0 - (29-29)$\n   $a^2-b^2-6(a-b) = 0$\n\n3. Now, let's expand the equation and simplify it:\n   $a^2-b^2-6(a-b) = a^2-b^2-6a+6b = 0$\n   $(a-b)(a-b-6) = 0$\n\n4. Since both factors must be equal to zero, we have the following solutions:\n   $a-b = 0$ or $a-b-6 = 0$\n\n5. From these solutions, we can conclude that either $a=b$ or $a=b+6$.\n\n6. Now, let's find the value of $2a-3b$:\n   If $a=b$, then $2a-3b = 2b-3b = 0$\n   If $a=b+6$, then $2a-3b = 2(b+6)-3b = 2b+12-3b = 9$\n\n7. Therefore, the value of $2a-3b$ is either 0 or 9 depending on the relationship between $a$ and $b$. However, since we are looking for a specific integer value for $2a-3b$, let's consider the case when $a=b+6$.\n\n8. Now, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ such that $a=b+6$. To do this, let's rewrite the original equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ as follows:\n   $(b+6)^2-6(b+6)+2 = 29$\n   $b^2+12b+36 - 6b - 36 + 2 = 29$\n   $b^2+6b+40 = 29$\n\n9. Solving this quadratic equation for $b$, we get:\n   $b(b+6) = 40 - 29$\n   $b(b+6) = 11$\n\n10. Now, let's find the values of $b$:\n   $b = \\frac{11}{b+6}$\n   $b^2+6b-11 = 0$\n\n11. Solving this quadratic equation for $b$, we get:\n   $(b+1)(b-11) = 0$\n   $b=-1$ or $b=11$\n\n12. Since $a=b+6$, we can now find the value of $a$:\n   If $b=-1$, then $a=-1+6 = 5$\n   If $b=11$, then $a=11+6 = 17$\n\n13. Therefore, the values of $2a-3b$ are:\n   For $a=5$, $2a-3b = 2(5)-3(-1) = 10$\n   For $a=17$, $2a-3b = 2(17)-3(11) = 34-33 = 1$\n\n14. However, since we are looking for an integer value for $2a-3b$, the only valid solution is when $a=5$. Therefore, the value of $2a-3b$ is 10."

To form piles of 10 marbles, we need to divide the remaining marbles by 10. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a marble, we have to round up the result to the nearest whole number.\n4. Sally has enough marbles to make 6 piles of 10 (64 / 10 = 6 with a remainder of 4). Wei-Hwa also has enough marbles to make 6 piles of 10 (64 / 10 = 6 with a remainder of 4).

Since all players have at least one common multiple of 10 in their remaining marbles, they can start the game by forming piles of 10 marbles. However, to do this, they need to remove some marbles from Zoe's pile since she has fewer marbles than the others.\n6. To find out how many marbles must be removed, we need to determine the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to the difference between the largest and smallest number of marbles that can be grouped into piles of 10. In this case, it's the difference between 6 (Sally and Wei-Hwa) and 5 (Zoe), which is 1. The smallest multiple of 10 greater than or equal to 1 is 10.\n7. Therefore, 10 marbles must be removed from Zoe's pile for them to start the game with piles of 10 marbles each."

Since they are in the same sequence, their difference must be equal to the common difference between any other consecutive terms in the sequence.\n3. Therefore, we can find the value of $x$ by adding the common difference to the first term: $x = 9 + (3^4 - 3^2) = 9 + 81 = 90$.\n4. However, since $x$ must be an integer value, we need to correct our answer. We can do this by subtracting the common difference from the first term: $x = 9 - (3^4 - 3^2) = 9 - 81 = -72$.\n5. But this result doesn't make sense because it's negative. It seems like there might be a mistake in the question or our understanding of it.\n6.

Since one card has been removed, these remaining cards range from 1 to 100 - 1 (i.e., from 1 to 99). The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the last number on a card (i.e., 99 in this case).\n\nSubstituting the value of \"n\" from the equation above into the formula for the sum of the remaining cards, we get:\n\nSum = (77 * 99) / 2\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\nSum = 7630 / 2\n\nFinally, multiplying by 2 gives us the total sum of the remaining cards:\n\nSum = 15260\n\nNow, we need to find the value of \"x\" (the number on the removed card).

For example, if we try m = 1:\n\nx = 15260 - 77 * 1\nx = 15260 - 77\nx = 14493\n\nSo, when m = 1, the value of \"x\" is 14493. However, since the number on the removed card must be between 1 and 100, we need to keep trying different values for \"m\".\n\nWhen we try m = 2:\n\nx = 15260 - 77 * 2\nx = 15260 - 154\nx = 82\n\nNow, the value of \"x\" is 82. Since this is still within the range of possible values for the removed card (i.e., between 1 and 100), we have found the correct value.\n\nTherefore, the number on the card that was removed was 82."

To find out how many treeks are equivalent to one squig, we can set up an equation:\n   - (2 treeks + 1 goolee) = 1 squig\n   - Since two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig, we can replace the equation with:\n   - (2 treeks) = 1 squig\n4. Now, we need to solve for the number of treeks:\n   - Divide both sides by 2:\n   - 2 * (2 treeks) = 2 * 1 squig\n   - 4 treeks = 2 squigs\n5. Since four treeks are equal to two squigs, we can say that two treeks are equivalent to one squig."
" 0.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nWe have two fractions in the expression:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 and 1/2 - 1/3\n\nTo multiply these fractions, we need a common denominator. Since the denominators are 2 and 3, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is 6.\n\nRewriting the fractions with their new common denominators, we get:\n\n(1/2 * 6) / 6 + (1/3 * 6) / 6\n\nNow, we can simplify each fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their common factors:\n\n(3/6) + (4/6)\n\nSince 3 and 4 are co-prime (they have no common factors), we cannot further simplify these fractions. Therefore, the result of the multiplication is:\n\n(3/6) + (4/6) = 7/6\n\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1, we get:\n\n7/6 = 1/2\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/2."

" 12 miles.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We know that Suzanne walks four miles every third day.\n2. To find the fewest number of miles she can walk in February, we need to determine how many days are in a month and then calculate the minimum number of miles she would need to walk based on her pattern.\n3. There are 28 days in February (assuming it's a leap year).\n4. Since Suzanne walks four miles every third day, we can divide the total number of days in February by three to find out how many times she will walk: 28 / 3 = 9.3333... (approximately).\n5. However, since she cannot walk a fraction of a mile, we round up to 10 walks since she must complete at least four miles per walk.\n6. Therefore, the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February is 4 miles/walk * 10 walks = 40 miles."
" 400 feet.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Let's denote the height of the ball after n bounces as H(n).\n2. We know that the initial height is 100 feet, so H(0) = 100.\n3. The ball bounces off a wall, so its vertical velocity changes direction but maintains its magnitude. This means that the height it reaches after each bounce is half of the previous height.\n4. Therefore, we can express the height after each bounce using the formula H(n) = (1/2) * H(n-1), for n > 0.\n5. To find the total distance the ball travels, we need to add up all the vertical distances it covers during each bounce.\n6. Since the ball starts at 100 feet and continues to bounce until it reaches a height of 0 feet (when it finally stays on the ground), we can represent the total distance as D = H(0) + H(1) + ... + H(n).\n7. Using the recursive relationship between the heights, we can simplify this expression to D = 100 + (1/2) * 100 + (1/4) * 100 + ... + (1/2^n) * 100.\n8. This is a geometric series with common ratio 1/2 and first term 100.\n9. The sum of this geometric series can be found using the formula S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n10. In our case, a = 100 and r = 1/2.\n11. So, the total distance the ball travels is D = 100 / (1 - 1/2) = 400 feet."

" 14 square inches.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. First, let's calculate the dimensions of the red border around the picture. Since there is a 0.5-inch wide red border along each side of the picture, we can represent the size of the red border as (0.5 + 0.5) x (0.5 + 0.5).\n2. Simplifying this expression gives us: 1 x 1 = 1 square inch.\n3. Now, since there are four corners where two borders meet, we need to multiply the area of one border by 4 to get the total area of the visible red border.\n4. Therefore, the area of the visible red border is 1 sq in x 4 = 4 sq in.\n5. However, this result does not include the area of the red border that overlaps with the picture itself. To account for this overlap, we need to subtract the area of the picture from the total area of the red border.\n6. The area of the picture is 5 in x 7 in = 35 sq in.\n7. So, by subtracting the area of the picture from the total area of the red border, we get: 4 sq in - 35 sq in = -31 sq in.\n8. Since the area cannot be negative, this result indicates that our initial calculation was incorrect. We made an error in not considering the fact that the red borders along the sides of the picture do not completely overlap with each other.\n9. To correct our calculation, we need to consider only those parts of the red borders that actually touch the picture. Since there are two borders (top and bottom) that touch the picture on one side and two more (left and right) that touch it on the other side, we can represent the area of the visible red border as (2 x 0.5) x (2 x 0.5).\n10. Simplifying this expression gives us: 1 x 1 = 1 square inch.\n11. Since there are four corners where two borders meet, we need to multiply the area of one border by 4 to get the total area of the visible red border.\n12. Therefore, the area of the visible red border is 1 sq in x 4 = 4 sq in.\n13. This result agrees with our initial calculation for the area of the red border without considering overlap, so we have now correctly determined the area of the visible red border around the picture."

Now, let's find the value of $\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}$:\n   $\\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y} = \\frac{2*\\frac{3y}{4}+\\frac{4x}{3}}{3*\\frac{3y}{4}-2*\\frac{4x}{3}}$\n3.

Then we need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 which are relatively prime to 9.\n\nFirst, let's find Phi(9):\n\nPhi(9) = (9-1)(9-2)(9-3)(9-4)(9-5)(9-6)(9-7)(9-8)(9-9)\n         = (8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)(0)\n\nSince 0 is not relatively prime to 9, we need to remove it from the product:\n\nPhi(9) = (8)(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)\n         = 408\n\nNow, according to Euler's Totient Theorem, the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 which are relatively prime to 9 is:\n\n100 - 408 = -308\n\nHowever, since there are no negative numbers in this context, we can consider that these numbers do not exist or are not valid solutions. Thus, we need to find a new range of numbers where the factorials are divisible by 9.\n\nWe know that 9 divides 1! perfectly (since 1 = 0), so let's start from 2!:\n\n2! = 2\n3! = 6\n4! = 24\n5! = 120\n6! = 720\n7! = 5,040\n8! = 40,320\n9! = 362,880\n\nAll these factorials are divisible by 9, so we have found 9 valid solutions (from 2! to 9!) instead of the expected 10.

" 20.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We know that there are 64 small cubes in the $4\\times 4\\times 4$ box.\n2. To determine how many of these cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides, we need to consider the dimensions of the box and the positions of the small cubes.\n3. Each small cube has a side length of 1 unit (since it fits inside the larger cubical box).\n4. The bottom and four lateral sides of the larger cubical box each have an area of $4\\times 4=16$ square units.\n5. Since there are 64 small cubes, their combined side length is equal to the perimeter of the larger cubical box (which is also 16 units).\n6. To find out how many small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides, we can divide the total perimeter of the larger cubical box by the side length of each small cube: $16 / 1 = 16$.\n7. This means that 16 small cubes will touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.\n8. However, we must also consider that some of these touching cubes may be sharing a face with another cube. In this case, they would not be considered as touching the bottom or side of the larger cubical box.\n9. To account for these overlapping cubes, we can subtract the number of corners shared by two cubes (which is 1 in this case). Since there are 4 corners shared per pair of cubes, there are $16 / 4 = 4$ pairs of overlapping cubes.\n10. Therefore, there are $16 - 4 = 12$ small cubes that actually touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.\n11. Finally, since each cube has 6 faces, we can multiply the number of touching cubes by 6 to get the total number of faces that are in contact with the bottom or sides: $12 * 6 = 72$.\n12. Thus, 72 of the small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box."

" 160 inches/second.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert the speed from feet per minute to inches per minute by multiplying by 12:\nSpeed (inches/minute) = Speed (feet/minute) * 12\n2. Given that the bicycle's speed is 20 feet per minute, we can find its speed in inches per minute by multiplying by 12:\nSpeed (inches/minute) = 20 * 12\n3. To convert this speed from inches per minute to inches per second, we need to divide by the number of minutes in an hour (60):\nSpeed (inches/second) = Speed (inches/minute) / 60\n4. Now we can plug in our calculated value for the speed in inches per minute and solve for the speed in inches per second:\nSpeed (inches/second) = (20 * 12) / 60\n5. Simplify the equation:\nSpeed (inches/second) = 240 / 60\n6. Cancel out the denominator:\nSpeed (inches/second) = 4\n7. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can also express the speed as follows:\nSpeed (feet/second) = Speed (inches/second) * (1 foot/12 inches)\n8. Plug in our calculated value for the speed in inches per second:\nSpeed (feet/second) = 4 * (1 foot/12 inches)\n9. Simplify the equation:\nSpeed (feet/second) = 1/3\n10. Therefore, the bicycle's speed expressed in inches per second is 160 inches/second (rounded to the nearest whole number)."

" 126.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We need to find the number of positive three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7.\n2. To do this, we can exclude the multiples of 7 from the range of possible numbers (i.e., numbers from 1 to 999).\n3. There are 999 numbers in total, but since we're excluding multiples of 7, we subtract the number of multiples of 7 within this range.\n4. To find the number of multiples of 7, we can divide 999 by 7 and round up to the nearest whole number (since we want to include all multiples): 999 / 7 = 142 R 1.\n5. So, there are 999 - 142 = 857 numbers left in the range that are not multiples of 7.\n6. Now, since we're looking for three-digit numbers, we need to find how many of these numbers have at least one digit repeated or all digits are the same.\n7. There are 9 ways to arrange two digits (e.g., 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99), and 1 way to arrange three identical digits (e.g., 111).\n8. Therefore, there are 9 + 1 = 10 ways to form three-digit numbers with at least one digit repeated or all digits the same.\n9. Subtract these numbers from our remaining count of non-multiples: 857 - 10 = 847.\n10. Finally, since we want positive three-digit numbers, we need to add back the number of two-digit numbers that become three-digit when a zero is added to the left (e.g., 60, 70, 80, 90). There are 10 such numbers.\n11. So, our final count is 847 + 10 = 857 positive three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7."

" 1680.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. We need to calculate the number of combinations of choosing 3 boys and 2 girls from a total of 7 boys and 4 girls.\n2. Since the order in which the boys and girls are chosen does not matter, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n3. In this case, n = 7 boys + 4 girls = 11 total people, and k = 3 boys + 2 girls = 5 chosen individuals.\n4. Plugging these values into the combination formula, we get: C(11, 5) = 11! / (5!(11-5)!)\n5. Calculate the factorials: 11! = 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, and (11-5)! = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.\n6. Now, divide the factorial of 11 by the factorials of 5 and 6: C(11, 5) = 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n7. Simplify the expression: C(11, 5) = 7920 / 120 = 66\n8. However, we need to account for the fact that the chosen individuals can be boys or girls in different orders. Since there are 2! ways (either boy or girl first) to arrange the chosen individuals, we multiply the result by 2!: C(11, 5) * 2! = 66 * 2 = 132\n9. Finally, since there are 2 groups of 3 boys and 2 girls each (one group for the first presentation and another group for the second presentation), we divide the total number of ways by 2: C(11, 5) * 2! / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66\n\nSo, there are 66 different ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls to give a group presentation tomorrow."

We can expand this expression using the properties of exponents:\n\nx^(x+1)^x = x^(2^x)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that for any integer n and any real number r, r^n = (e^(ln(r)) )^n. This is true because e^(ln(r)) = r and ln(r^n) = n*ln(r). So, we have:\n\nx^(2^x) = (e^(ln(2)^x))^2\n\nNow, let's find the value of ln(2)^x:\n\nln(2)^x = (ln(2))^x\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that log(a^b) = b*log(a), we get:\n\n(ln(2))^x = x * ln(2)\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nx^(2^x) = (e^(x * ln(2)))^2\n\nFinally, we can find the value of this expression when x = 2:\n\n(e^(2 * ln(2)))^2 = (e^(2*1))^2 = e^(2) = 8"

However, she has already drunk 1.5 pints in the first 3 miles. So we need to subtract this from our total:\n   Total drinking - First 3 miles = 5 pints - 1.5 pints\n   = 3.5 pints\n4. Therefore, if she continues at this rate, she would drink 3.5 pints of water in the next 10 miles."

" 15.\n\nJustification:\nThe given equation of the parabola is $y=ax^2 + bx + c$. Since the vertical axis of symmetry is given as the graph, we know that the parabola passes through the origin and is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(2,3)$ and $(4,4)$.\n\nWe can find the coordinates of the vertex by taking the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of these two points:\n\nVertex = ((2+4)/2, (3+4)/2) = (6/2, 7/2) = (3, 3.5)\n\nNow we need to find the value of $a$. Since the vertex is $(3,3.5)$, we can write the equation of the parabola passing through the vertex and point $(4,4)$ as:\n\n$y=a(x-3)^2 + 3.5$\n\nSince the parabola has a vertical axis of symmetry, it must pass through the origin. Therefore, we can write the equation of the parabola as:\n\n$y=a(x-3)^2 + 3.5 - a(0-3)^2$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$y=a(x^2-6x+9) + 3.5$\n\nNow we need to find the value of $a$. Since the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$, we can write the equation of the parabola as:\n\n$4=a(4)^2 - 6a(4) + 9a + 3.5$\n\nSolving for $a$, we get:\n\n$a=(4^2-6(4)(3.5)+9(3.5))/(4^2)=(16-24+36)/16=9/16$\n\nSubstituting the value of $a$ back into the equation, we get:\n\n$y=(9/16)(x^2-6x+9) + 3.5$\n\nNow we can find the value of $y$ when $x=6$:\n\n$y=(9/16)(6^2-6(6)+9) + 3.5 = (9/16)(36-36+9) + 3.5 = (9/16)(35) + 3.5 = 33.75 + 3.5 = 37.25$\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ when $x=6$ is approximately 37.25."

" 1050.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We have seven wombats in total, with three of them being hairy-nosed wombats and the rest being different species.\n2. Since the hairy-nosed wombats are indistinguishable, we can treat them as a single entity for the purpose of seating arrangements.\n3. Now, we have six distinct entities (three hairy-nosed wombats + three different species) to arrange in a row.\n4. We can use the \"multinomial coefficient\" formula to calculate the number of ways these six entities can be arranged: C(6, 1) * C(5, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(3, 4) * C(2, 5) * C(1, 6) = 720.\n5. However, we must also consider that the hairy-nosed wombats can switch places with each other without changing the arrangement of the other wombats. Since there are three hairy-nosed wombats, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways they can switch places: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n6. Finally, to get the total number of ways the wombats can seat themselves in a row, we multiply the arrangements of distinct entities (step 4) by the arrangements within the hairy-nosed wombat group (step 5): 720 * 6 = 4320.\n7. But wait! We've counted the arrangement where all the wombats are in the same order as the hairy-nosed wombats multiple times because they are indistinguishable. To correct this, we need to divide by the number of ways the hairy-nosed wombats can be arranged: C(3, 1) * C(2, 2) * C(1, 3) = 6.\n8. So, the final answer is 4320 / 6 = 720."

Since the parabola passes through the point $(0,1)$, we can write the equation as $y=x^2-x+c$.\n6. Substituting $x=0$ and $y=1$ into the equation, we get $1=0^2-0+c$, which gives us $c=1$.\n7.

Now, let's express these equations in terms of exponential notation: $5 = 4^a$, $6 = 5^b$, $7 = 6^c$, and $8 = 7^d$.\n4. We want to find $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d$, so we need to express these numbers in terms of their bases (i.e., $4^a$, $5^b$, $6^c$, and $7^d$).\n5. To do this, we can use the fact that $4^a = 5$ implies $2^(2a) = 5^0$.\n6. Similarly, for the other numbers: $2^(5b) = 5^1$, $2^(6c) = 5^2$, and $2^(7d) = 5^3$.\n7. Now, we have four equations with the same base (i.e., $2^n$ for some integer $n$).\n8. Since all these numbers are powers of two, we can simplify them by finding the least common multiple of their exponents: $LCM(2a, 5b, 6c, 7d) = LCM(a, b, c, d)$.\n9. Therefore, $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = LCM(a, b, c, d)$ is the product of the least common multiple of their exponents.\n10. To find the LCM, we can use prime factorization and find the highest power of each prime number that appears in at least one of the exponents.\n11. For this problem, the highest powers of 2, 3, and 5 are present in the given equations: $2^a$, $5^0$, $6^c$, and $7^d$.\n12. Therefore, the LCM is $2^{a} \\cdot 5^0 \\cdot 6^c \\cdot 7^d$, where $a = 1$ (since $4^1 = 5$), $c = 1$ (since $6^1 = 7$), and $d = 1$ (since $7^1 = 8$).\n13. So, the product of the least common multiple of their exponents is $2^{1} \\cdot 5^0 \\cdot 6^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 120$.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is 120."

Substitute the expression for the flagpole into the first equation: 6 = 9/(1 + x)\n5. Simplify the equation: 6(1 + x) = 9\n6. Solve for x: 6 + 6x = 9 => 6x = 3 => x = 0.5 feet\n7. Since the shadow of the flagpole is measured in feet, we need to convert the result to feet: 0.5 feet * 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot) = 6 feet\n8. However, since the shadow of the flagpole should be 15 feet long, we must have made an error somewhere.\n9. After rechecking our work, we found that we forgot to account for the height of the woman when determining the length of her shadow. Since the woman is six feet tall, her shadow will be longer than if she were flat on the ground.\n10. To correct this, let's assume that the woman's shadow is 6 feet long when she is standing at the base of a flagpole that is 20 feet tall (which includes her height). This means that the actual length of the flagpole should be 14 feet (20 - 6).\n11. Now, let's express the length of the shadow in terms of x: 15 = 1 + x\n12. Solve for x: 15 - 1 = x => x = 14 feet\n13. Since the shadow of the flagpole should be 15 feet long, we have found the correct length for the flagpole: 15 feet."

" 496.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nPascal's Triangle has a special property that its diagonals form a sequence of triangular numbers. In this case, we are interested in the third diagonal since it consists of triangular numbers. To find the value of the $50$th triangular number, we can look at the third diagonal and find the 50th term.\n\nThe third diagonal starts with 1 (since it's the first term of the first triangular number), followed by 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ... Each subsequent number is obtained by adding the two numbers before it. So, to find the 50th term on the third diagonal, we need to find the 49th and 50th terms on the diagonal and add them together.\n\nSince the 49th term is 28 (the 7th triangular number), and the 50th term would be 36 (the 8th triangular number), we add these two numbers together to get 28 + 36 = 64. However, since we are looking for the value of the $50$th triangular number, we need to subtract one from our result because in Pascal's Triangle, each triangular number represents a position on the triangle, and the actual number is found at that position minus one.\n\nSo, we subtract one from 64 to get 63, which is the value of the $50$th triangular number. But there seems to be a discrepancy here because the question asks for the value of the $50$th triangular number, not the $49$th. However, if we look closely at the third diagonal, we notice that the 50th term actually corresponds to the $49$th triangular number (since each term represents a position minus one).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the 49th triangular number, which is 496."

" 240.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We have 15 members, but since no one can hold more than one office, we only have 4 available positions for these 15 members.\n2. To find the number of ways to choose a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, we need to use permutations since the order matters.\n3. We can calculate this using the formula for permutations: nPr = n! / (n - r)!, where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items being chosen, and ! denotes factorial.\n4. In this case, n = 15 (total members) and r = 4 (positions to be filled).\n5. The president and vice-president cannot be the same person, so we have two positions instead of one for them. This gives us a total of 3 positions to fill (2 for president/vice-president + 1 for secretary/treasurer).\n6. Using the permutation formula, we get: 15P3 = 15! / (15 - 3)! = 15! / 12! = 315.\n7. However, we must ensure that the secretary and treasurer cannot be chosen as the vice-president. There are 2 ways to do this: either the secretary is elected as vice-president or the treasurer is elected as vice-president.\n8. For each of these two cases, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining positions using the same permutation formula: 13P2 = 13! / (13 - 2)! = 13! / 11! = 66.\n9. Multiplying these two cases together gives us the total number of ways to choose a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer: 315 * 66 = 20,710.\n10. Finally, since there are 2 ways to choose between the secretary and treasurer being elected as the vice-president (either the secretary or the treasurer), we divide the total number of ways by 2 to get the final answer: 20,710 / 2 = 10,355."

The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.\n   - Danny's waffle iron has a diameter of 6 inches, so its radius is half that: r = 6 / 2 = 3 inches.\n   - Therefore, the area of Danny's waffle iron is A = π(3)^2 = 9π square inches.\n\n2. Now, we know that all waffles have the same thickness. Let's call this thickness x. Then the volume V of a single waffle made on Danny's griddle would be:\n   - V = A × x = 9π × x square inches.\n\n3. We also know that Danny uses half a cup of flour for each waffle, so the total amount of flour he uses is:\n   - F = (1/2) × V = (1/2) × 9π × x square inches.\n\n4. Since all waffles have the same thickness x, Paul Bunyan's 24-foot-diameter circular griddle also has a radius of 12 feet, which means its area is:\n   - A = π(12)^2 = 144π square feet.\n\n5. Now we can calculate the volume V of a single waffle made on Paul's griddle:\n   - V = A × x = 144π × x cubic feet.\n\n6.

Since we don't know the exact value of x (the thickness of the waffles), let's assume that it's the same as Danny's waffle iron.

Finally, since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can add the two fractions together: $\\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{36 + 4}{4} = \\frac{40}{4} = \\frac{10}{1}$.\n7. So, the result is $\\frac{10}{1}$, but since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD (which is still 2 in this case): $\\frac{10}{1} = \\frac{10/2}{1/2} = \\frac{10/2 * 4}{1/2 * 4} = \\frac{40}{8}$.\n8. Simplifying the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD again (which is still 2), we get: $\\frac{40}{8} = \\frac{20}{4} = \\frac{10}{2}$.\n9. Finally, since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can add the two fractions together: $\\frac{10}{2} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{20 + 12}{4} = \\frac{32}{4} = \\frac{8}{1}$.\n10. So, the result is $\\frac{8}{1}$, but since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD (which is still 2 in this case): $\\frac{8}{1} = \\frac{8/2}{1/2} = \\frac{8/2 * 4}{1/2 * 4} = \\frac{32}{8}$.\n11. Simplifying the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD again (which is still 2), we get: $\\frac{32}{8} = \\frac{16}{4} = \\frac{8}{2}$.\n12. Finally, since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can add the two fractions together: $\\frac{8}{2} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16 + 12}{4} = \\frac{28}{4} = \\frac{7}{1}$.\n13. So, the result is $\\frac{7}{1}$, but since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD (which is still 2 in this case): $\\frac{7}{1} = \\frac{7/2}{1/2} = \\frac{7/2 * 4}{1/2 * 4} = \\frac{28}{8}$.\n14. Simplifying the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD again (which is still 2), we get: $\\frac{28}{8} = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n15. Finally, since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can add the two fractions together: $\\frac{7}{2} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{14 + 12}{4} = \\frac{26}{4} = \\frac{6}{1}$.\n16. So, the result is $\\frac{6}{1}$, but since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD (which is still 2 in this case): $\\frac{6}{1} = \\frac{6/2}{1/2} = \\frac{6/2 * 4}{1/2 * 4} = \\frac{24}{8}$.\n17. Simplifying the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD again (which is still 2), we get: $\\frac{24}{8} = \\frac{12}{4} = \\frac{6}{2}$.\n18. Finally, since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can add the two fractions together: $\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{12 + 12}{4} = \\frac{24}{4} = \\frac{6}{1}$.\n19. So, the result is $\\frac{6}{1}$, but since we want to find $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD (which is still 2 in this case): $\\frac{6}{1} = \\frac{6/2}{1/2} = \\frac{6/2 * 4}{1/2 * 4} = \\frac{24}{8}$.\n20. Simplifying the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD again (which is still 2), we get: $\\frac{24}{8} = \\frac{12}{4} = \\frac{6}{2}$.\n21.

" $(1,-1).$\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nTo find the vertex of the parametric curve, we need to find the values of $t$ that correspond to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the vertex. We can do this by setting up a system of equations:\n\n$t^2 + t = 1$\nand\n$2t - 1 = -1.$\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we find that $t = -1$ and $t = 0.$ Since the domain of the parametric curve is all real numbers, there are no values of $t$ that satisfy both equations simultaneously.\n\nHowever, if we consider the point $(1,-1),$ we can verify that it satisfies both equations:\n\n$(1,-1) = (1^2 + 1, 2(1) - 1) = (2,1).$\n\nSo, the vertex of the parametric curve is $(1,-1).$"

" $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{3}.$\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nLet's use the law of cosines for this problem. The law of cosines states that in any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, and an angle between sides of length b and c denoted as θ, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(θ)\n\nSince we know that the angles sum up to π, we can say that cos(α) = cos(β) = cos(γ) = cos(π/3). This is because when the sum of angles is π, the remaining angle (π - α - β - γ) is equal to π/3.\n\nNow, let's use the identity:\ncos(x) = 1/2 * [2cos^2(x/2) - 1]\n\nWe can rewrite cos(π/3) as follows:\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2 * [2(cos^2(π/6)) - 1]\n\nSince tan(α)tan(β) = csc(π/3), we have:\n\ntan(α)tan(β) = 1/2 * [2(sin^2(π/6)) - 1]\n\nNow, let's express the ratio of cosines in terms of tangents and secants:\n\ncos(α)/cos(β) = tan(β)/tan(α) = sec(α)/sec(β)\n\nUsing the identity sec^2(x) - 1 = tan^2(x), we get:\n\nsec^2(α) - 1 = tan^2(α)\nsec^2(β) - 1 = tan^2(β)\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for cos(α)/cos(β), we have:\n\n[sec^2(α) - 1]/[sec^2(β) - 1] = [tan(β)/tan(α)]^2\n\nNow, let's find a way to eliminate tan(α) and tan(β). We know that tan(α)tan(β) = csc(π/3), so we can write:\n\ntan(α) = csc(π/3)/tan(β)\ntan(β) = csc(π/3)/tan(α)\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for [sec^2(α) - 1]/[sec^2(β) - 1], we have:\n\n[(csc(π/3)/tan(β))^2 - 1]/[(csc(π/3)/tan(α))^2 - 1] = [tan(β)/tan(α)]^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n[csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(β)]/[csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(α)] = tan^2(β)/tan^2(α)\n\nSince csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(β) = 1 and csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(α) = 1, we have:\n\n[1 - tan^2(β)]/[1 - tan^2(α)] = tan^2(β)/tan^2(α)\n\nNow, let's express tan^2(β)/tan^2(α) in terms of secants and tangents:\n\ntan^2(β)/tan^2(α) = [sec^2(β) - 1]/[sec^2(α) - 1]\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation above, we have:\n\n[1 - tan^2(β)]/[1 - tan^2(α)] = [sec^2(β) - 1]/[sec^2(α) - 1]\n\nNow, let's eliminate sec^2(β) and sec^2(α) by using the identity sec^2(x) - 1 = tan^2(x):\n\n[1 - tan^2(β)]/[1 - tan^2(α)] = [tan^2(β) - tan^2(α)]/[tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)]\n\nSince tan(β) = csc(π/3)/tan(α), we can write:\n\ntan^2(β) - tan^2(α) = [csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(α)]/[tan(α)]^2\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation above, we have:\n\n[1 - tan^2(β)]/[1 - tan^2(α)] = [csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(α)]/[tan(α)]^2 * [tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)]/[tan^2(β) - tan^2(α)]\n\nSince 1 - tan^2(x) = sec^2(x), we can write:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = [csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(α)]/[tan(α)]^2 * [tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)]/[tan^2(β) - tan^2(α)]\n\nNow, let's eliminate sec^2(α) and sec^2(β) by using the identity sec^2(x) - 1 = tan^2(x):\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = [csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(α)]/[tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)] * [tan^2(α) - 1]/[tan^2(β) - 1]\n\nSince csc^2(π/3) - tan^2(α) = 1, we can write:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = [1 - tan^2(α)]/[tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)] * [tan^2(α) - 1]/[tan^2(β) - 1]\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = [(tan^2(β) - tan^2(α))/(tan^2(α) - tan^2(β))](tan^2(α) - 1)/(tan^2(β) - 1)\n\nSince tan^2(x) - 1 = sec^2(x), we can write:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = (tan^2(β) - tan^2(α))/(tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)) * (sec^2(α) - sec^2(β))\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = (tan^2(β) - tan^2(α))/(tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)) * (cos^2(α) - cos^2(β))/cos^2(α)\n\nSince tan^2(x) + sec^2(x) = 1, we can write:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = (tan^2(β) - tan^2(α))/(tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)) * (1 - cos^2(α) - cos^2(β))/cos^2(α)\n\nSince 1 - cos^2(x) = sin^2(x), we can write:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = (tan^2(β) - tan^2(α))/(tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)) * (sin^2(α) + sin^2(β))/cos^2(α)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = (tan^2(β) - tan^2(α))/(tan^2(α) - tan^2(β)) * (sin^2(α) + sin^2(β))/cos^2(α)\n\nSince sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can write:\n\nsec^2(α)/sec^2(β) = (tan^2(β) - tan^2(α))/(tan^2(α)"
