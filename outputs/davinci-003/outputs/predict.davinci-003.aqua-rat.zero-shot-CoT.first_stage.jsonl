"\nThe formula to calculate the average speed is s = d/t where, s is the average speed, d is the total distance and t is the total time. The total distance covered around the square will be the sum of distances covered on all sides.\nSince the plane flies at different speeds on different sides, we need to calculate the total distance covered on each side and then sum up these distances.\nThe distance covered by the plane on any side = speed × time. Since the plane changes its direction after covering half the side, the time taken will be half the side length divided by the speed.\nSo, the distance covered on any side = speed × (side length/2)\nNow, let's calculate the distance covered on each side:\n1st side: 200 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 400 m\n2nd side: 400 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 800 m\n3rd side: 600 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 1200 m\n4th side: 800 km/hr × (400 m/2) = 1600 m\nNow, let's sum up the distances covered on all sides:\nTotal distance = 400 m + 800 m + 1200 m + 1600 m = 5000 m\nNow, let's calculate the average speed:\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nTotal time = (side length) × (number of sides) = 400 m × 4 = 1600 m\nAverage speed = 5000 m / 1600 m = 3.125 km/hr\nThe answer: (E)."

So, to find the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, we need to determine how many quarters of a mile the $8.50 will cover.\nFirst, we need to determine how much the cab charges for one quarter mile: The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. So, the charge for one quarter mile is $3.50 + 10¢ = $3.60.\nThen, we divide the total amount of money ($8.50) by the cost per quarter mile ($3.60): $8.50 / $3.60 ≈ 2.36. Since we cannot have a fraction of a quarter mile, we round up to the nearest whole number which is 3.\nSo, with $8.50, you can travel 3 quarters of a mile.\nThe maximum distance you can travel is 3 quarters of a mile which is 11.75 miles. The answer: (A)."

"\nArjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This means that after Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have 2x dollars.\nIf Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This means that after Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have 3(y-10) dollars.\nThe problem states that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2x = 3(y-10).\nNow let's solve this equation for y in terms of x. We can first add 10 to both sides of the equation: 2x + 10 = 3y - 30. Then, we can divide both sides by 3: (2x + 10)/3 = y - 10. Finally, we can subtract 10 from both sides and solve for y: (2x + 10)/3 = y.\nNow let's find the value of x. We know that Sajal has twice the money left with Arjun after Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2x = 3(y-10). Substitute y from above: 2x = 3((2x + 10)/3 - 10)\nSimplify and solve for x: 2x = 2x + 10 - 30 => 2x = -20 => x = -10.\nSince the amount of money cannot be negative, there is no solution to this problem.

" Independent events are events whose occurrence does not depend on the outcome of other events. If A and B are independent, then the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. This means that the probability of the union of A and B is 0.96. We know that the probability of the union of two events is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the product of their individual probabilities. So, we can set up an equation using this information: 0.96 = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB). Since A and B are independent, P(AB) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting this into the equation gives us: 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)). Solving for P(B): 0.96 - 0.6 - 0.6P(B) = 0. Therefore, 0.36 = -0.6P(B). Solving for P(B): P(B) = 0.36 / -0.6.

"\nQ: What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out?\nA: The question asks for the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be made with 28 white and 98 red tulips. This implies that each bouquet should have an equal number of both white and red tulips. So, we need to find the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be formed by dividing the total number of tulips equally among them.\nThe total number of tulips is 98 (red) + 28 (white) = 126 tulips. If we divide these 126 tulips equally among the bouquets, each bouquet will have 126/4 = 31.5 tulips. Since we cannot have half a tulip, this is not possible.\nThe next multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 126 is 128. So, we can form 128/4 = 32 bouquets with 126 tulips. However, since 126 is not a multiple of 32, some of these bouquets will have fewer tulips than others.\nThe greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips is 32.

"\nThe problem is asking for highest simple interest rate. Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. Here time is given in years and rate is compounded annually.\nSo, the formula becomes SI = P * R * T Where P = 20000, R = ?, T = 30/12 (as 4/30 means 4 equal installments in 30 days) Now we need to maximize the simple interest rate.\nThe problem is that there is also a discount of n/100 which means the merchant will get a discount of n% on the invoice amount. This discount will reduce the principal amount. So, the effective principal becomes (20000 - 2000n) Now we need to maximize the simple interest rate with this effective principal.\nThe formula for simple interest with effective principal becomes SI = (P - D) * R * T Where P - D = 20000 - 2000n and D is the discount in dollars.\nNow let's express the discount in terms of rate. Since n/100 means n% discount, we can write D = 0.02n Now we have to maximize the simple interest rate with respect to this new variable (D or n).\nThe formula becomes SI = (20000 - 0.02n) * R * (30/12) Now let's differentiate the simple interest rate with respect to n and set it equal to zero to find the maximum rate.\ndSI/dn = -0.02R*(30/12) Now setting this equation equal to zero, we get 0.02R*(30/12) = 0 This simplifies to R = (30/6)*(1/2) = 5 The highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 5%.

"\nStep 1: We know that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents. So, to find the cost of one bottle of soda in terms of A, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles.\nCost of 1 bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles\n= A / 27\nStep 2: Now we know that the cost of one bottle of soda is in terms of A. We need to convert this into B dollars. Since A and B are different units (A is in cents and B is in dollars), we have to convert A into B using the conversion factor.\nCost of 1 bottle in B dollars = Cost of 1 bottle in A cents * Conversion factor from A cents to B dollars\n= (A / 27) * (B/100)\nFinal answer: (E)."
"\nThe problem asks for combinations, not permutations. Also, it asks for a specific type of combination: those that cost more than $4.\n\nWe can use inclusion-exclusion principle to solve this problem. First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 candy bars out of 11, using the formula C(n,k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]. Then, we subtract out the combinations that cost less than $4.\n\nTotal combinations = C(11,3) = 11! / [3!(11-3)!] = 85\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of combinations that cost less than $4. We can do this by considering the cost of each type of candy bar separately and then multiplying by the number of ways to choose 3 candy bars of that type.\n\nCombination costing less than $4 = (3*50) + (4*1) + (4*2) = 150 + 4 + 8 = 162\n\nSo, we subtract the number of combinations that cost less than $4 from the total number of combinations to get the number of combinations that cost more than $4.\n\nNumber of combinations costing more than $4 = Total combinations - Combination costing less than $4 = 85 - 162 = -77\n\nSince we are asked for the number of ways, we take the absolute value of the result.\n\nFinal answer: (E)."
"\nThe team has 4 men and 4 women so in total it has 8 people. Since a group cannot consist of only men or only women, we have to choose 2 people from the group of 8 such that one is a man and the other is a woman. This way we are ensuring that both genders are represented in each group.\nThere are C(4,1) ways to choose 1 man from the group of 4 and then there are C(4,1) ways to choose 1 woman from the remaining 4 people. So total number of ways = C(4,1)*C(4,1) = 4*4 = 16.\nFinal answer: (E)."
"\nThe number of girls is 2/5th of the total number of children. We know that there are 100 boys in the class, so the total number of children is 100 + k, where k is the number of girls.

"\nThe number of pairs of relatively prime numbers less than n is given by Euler’s totient function φ(n). The formula for φ(n) is φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1), where p and q are the prime factors of n. So, for n=1000, the number of relatively prime pairs would be φ(1000) = (100-1)(99-1) = 900*99 = 89,100. The total number of pairs of numbers less than 1000 is 1000*1000/2 = 500,000. So the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 89,100/500,000. Simplifying this fraction gives us (A)."
