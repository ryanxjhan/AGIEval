"\nThe total weight of the packages should be less than or equal to 1,100 pounds. The total weight of the packages is 10a + 12b where a and b are the number of 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages respectively.\nSo, 10a + 12b â‰¤ 1,100\nWe need to maximize the value of b. For this we can divide the entire problem by 10.\nThis gives us a new inequality 1 + 1.2b â‰¤ 1,100/10\nNow simplify the inequality 1.2b â‰¤ 1,100/10 - 1\nNow divide the entire inequality by 1.2 to get b â‰ˆ 916.67/1.2 â‰ˆ 765.58 Approximately.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a package, we round down to b = 765 We can carry 765 packages. Answer: (D)."

"\nThe given expression can be factored as follows:$$(4x+4)(a x-1)-x^{2}+4=(4x+4)(ax-1)-(x^2-4)$$Now, we need to find a constant $b$ such that the given expression is equivalent to $bx$. So, we will compare the coefficients of $x$ and the constants on both sides.\nThe coefficient of $x$ on the left side is $4a$, while on the right side it is $b$. Therefore, $4a=b$.\nSo, the answer is (A)."
"\nWe have two equations: 2w + 4t = 14 and 4w + 5t = 25. We need to find the value of 2w + 3t.\nSince we have two variables in two equations, we can eliminate one variable by substitution. Let's substitute the value of 4t from the first equation into the second equation: 4w + 5(4t/4) = 25 => 4w + 5t = 25. Now, we have only one variable left, which is w.\nNow, let's find the value of w: 4w + 5t = 25 => 4w = 25 - 5t => 4w = 10 - t. Now, we need to find the value of 2w + 3t.\nSubstitute the value of w in terms of t: 2w + 3t = (2 * 4w/4) + 3t => 2w + 3t = 8w/4 + 3t => 2w + 3t = 2(4w/4) + 3t => 2w + 3t = 2(10 - t) => 2w + 3t = 20 - 2t.\nNow, we need to find the value of 2w + 3t: 2w + 3t = 20 - 2t => 2w + 3t = 18/2 => 2w + 3t = 9.\nThe answer is (C)."
