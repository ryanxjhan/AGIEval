"\nStep 1: The relevant sentence in the passage is: Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.\nSo, the answer is (B)."
"\nStep 1: Identify the relevant information.\nAnswer: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.\nStep 2: Analyze the information.\nGentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers. This statement is supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment.\nSo, the answer is (C)."
"\nStep 1: Identify key points from the passage.\n- In 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these \"low-threshold\" nerves \"C-tactile,\" or CT, fibers, said Olausson, because of their \"exquisite sensitivity\" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.\n- The group decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.\n- Olausson wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?\n- The researchers tested a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. She had lost responsiveness to pressure, but could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting fibers were intact.\n- Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex was active when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm.\nStep 2: Determine the answer.\nThe relevant sentence in the passage is: This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. The answer is (A)."

"\nStep 1: Ken Dial observed that young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their parents like popcorn. This observation led him to hypothesize that young birds learn to fly by jumping up and down.\nStep 2: He used Chukar Partridge as a model species because they were easy to get from a local rancher. But the rancher told him that ground birds don't like to be on the ground; they prefer to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches.\nStep 3: Ken realized that the rancher was right and brought in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on. When he came back from his trip, his son Terry told him that the birds were cheating because they were using their legs to climb up the hay bales instead of flying.\nStep 4: Ken and Terry then conducted a series of experiments filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps at increasing angles. They found that the birds used their wings not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. This technique was called WAIR (wing-assisted incline running).\nStep 5: The discovery of WAIR led Ken and Terry to reconsider the ground-up theory and the tree-down theory, as it provided a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.\nAnswer: (C)."

"\nStep 1: Identify the key points in the passage.\n- The poor market may be slowing innovation, but advances continue; judging by the mood this week at the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n- The technology that’s surprised almost everyone. is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared that they’d never go below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,” he says.\n- The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants.\n- All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady cost reductions. Green points to something as mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of the features on solar panels. Recent research suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of the lines Green used for his record solar cells.\n- One of Green’s former students and colleagues, Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of a company called Solid Power, is betting on silicon. He hopes to greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels by combining silicon with one or two other semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert efficiently.\nStep 2: Identify the key verbs in the passage.\n- surprised, declared, set, think, bring, lead, suggest, cofounder, hope.\nStep 3: Map out the passage using the key points and verbs.\n- The poor market may be slowing innovation, but advances continue; judging by the mood this week at the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n- Technology that’s surprised almost everyone is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and Martin Green, professor at the University of New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar panel researchers, declared that they’d never go below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per watt,” he says.\n- The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020. Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the direct cost of solar power to six cents per kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost expected for power from new natural gas power plants.\n- All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady cost reductions.
